## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The mixing robot: one check as a state machine – pump on, prove flow,
  flush, measure until stable, EC before pH, dose in partial doses, mix in
  with flow, measure again and learn, hold; no dose without proven flow; a
  small test dose that checks the volume of a new tank (SD-105).
- The dosing journal: a dose is on record before its pump starts, and one
  cut by a restart is reported and mixed before the next measurement
  (SD-106).
- EC compensated to 25 °C; without a water temperature EC is no value for
  control (RAT-089).
- Web app: status, recipe with how long it applies, tank with volume, flow,
  turnover time and mixing waits, history of pH, EC, temperature and flow,
  calibration of the dosing pumps and probes, settings, and the Stop on
  every page.
- Simulator with a twin of tank, measuring chamber, flow, pumps and probes.
- History as CSV, from the history page or `GET /api/v1/export.csv`
  (`series`, `from`, `to`, `lang`; a week of all four curves by
  default): a row per time in UTC; in German with semicolons and a
  decimal comma, in English with commas and a decimal point; a gap stays
  an empty field (RAT-016, from the predecessor).
- Downloads of the simulator with the web app built in, for Linux, macOS
  and Windows: started without arguments it takes the next free port
  from 8080 and opens the browser. A tag on `main` releases them with
  checksums and a provenance attestation (`docs/RELEASE.md`).
- "Why it doses – or not" on the status page: a checklist of what
  nutrients and pH− each need now – recipe and tank volume, flow at the
  last check, readings, canisters on calibrated pumps, locks, the EC gate
  and the rest after a nutrient dose – each ticked or not, with the
  reason (RAT-037, from the predecessor). The API has it as
  `cycle.checks`.

### Changed

- Started from growcontroller-software at a3b00d1 without its history
  (`docs/PROVENANCE.md`); grow-only parts left behind.
- The repository is public, under AGPL-3.0-or-later with the additional
  permission (SD-116). New: `SUPPORT.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue
  forms for bugs and feedback; `SECURITY.md` reports through GitHub's
  private vulnerability reporting.
- Two recipe templates name no manufacturer any more: "Three-part feed,
  vegetative wk 1–4" and "… flowering wk 1–2", with the same values
  (SD-116).
- Doseph's terms (SD-107): a bottle is now a canister, and what it holds
  is its role (nutrient or pH−); the flow cell is the measuring chamber.
  The API names them `canisters`, `canister` and `role`
  (`POST /api/v1/canisters`, `DELETE /api/v1/canisters/<id>`). A saved
  configuration of schema 1 is read and brought to schema 2.
